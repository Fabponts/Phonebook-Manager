## Description
This is a console-based phonebook application built with Java and MySQL. It allows users to manage contact information through a structured CRUD system (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The project follows a layered architecture, separating concerns into entities, controllers, views, and data access objects (DAO).

## How it works:
### Prerequisites:
- Java JDK 17 or higher:
  Required to compile and run the application
- MySQL Server:
  Used to store contact data. You should have a database named phonebook with a table called contacts
- MySQL Workbench or any SQL client:
  Optional, for managing the database manually.
- JDBC Driver for MySQL:
Ensure the MySQL Connector/J is included in your project dependencies.
- IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code):
  Recommended for editing and running the Java code.
